# Sapphire

Modern **secure** and **private** messenger with end-to-end encryption.

**Secure** means protection from danger. **Private** means protection from observation.

# Implementation details

Built on [Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm).

The following cryptographic algorithms were selected: [X25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) for key exchange, [XChaCha20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant) for encryption, [HKDF-SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF) for keys derivation and [HMAC-SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-SHA256) for authentication.

### Why not XChaCha20-Poly1305?
